commit suicide 
jump off a bridge
i want to overdose
i’m a burden
i’m such a burden
i will overdose
thinking about overdose
kill myself 
killing myself
hang myself
hanging myself 
cut myself
cutting myself
hurt myself
hurting myself
want to die, wanna die
don’t want to wake up
don’t wake up
never want to wake up
don’t want to be alive
want to be alive
wish it would all end
done with living
want it to end
it all ends tonight
live anymore
living anymore
life anymore
be dead
take it anymore
end my life
think about death
hopeless, hurt myself
no one will miss me
don’t want to wake up
if i live or die
